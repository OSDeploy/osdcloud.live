## Overview

This repository contains the working files that support the osdcloud.live experience. It is currently focused on validating installation flows, device preparation, and OOBE/WinPE automation before promoting them to production use.

## What to expect during testing

- Frequent changes while workflows and scripts stabilize
- Limited documentation depth; some modules may be undocumented or in flux
- Potential breaking changes without migration guidance until the test phase completes

## Contributing and feedback

- File issues with clear repro steps and logs where possible.
- When proposing changes, include updates to documentation alongside code updates.
- Expect iteration while we collect feedback and harden the flows.
